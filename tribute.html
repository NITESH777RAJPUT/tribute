    <p>Mahatma Gandhi, known as the Father of the Nation in India, was a leader of nonviolent resistance against British rule. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, his philosophy of <span class="highlight">Ahimsa</span> (nonviolence) inspired millions worldwide. Gandhi's life was a testament to simplicity, truth, and equality, principles that shaped India's struggle for independence.</p>
    <p>Through movements like the Dandi Salt March and Quit India Movement, Gandhi showed the power of peaceful protest. His ability to unite people from diverse backgrounds was remarkable, making him a global symbol of peace. He advocated for self-reliance through initiatives like Khadi and village industries, promoting economic independence alongside political freedom.</p>
    <p>Assassinated on January 30, 1948, his legacy lives on, teaching us the strength of peace and perseverance. Gandhi’s writings, including his autobiography *The Story of My Experiments with Truth*, continue to inspire readers to embrace nonviolence and ethical living.</p>
